where do we put data?
mySQL: we have a tabel
mongodb: we have collection

[
    {
        key: 123
    },
    {
        key: "now as as string"
        anotherKey: "456"
    }
    {
    }
]


mySQL
-----
great for data that needs to adhere to a rigid schema, structured data
great for when the business requiremtns are not pront to change
enforce checks of data type etc. and fails on the db level.
Can give quite a head ache when trying to split up / shard / scale


mongodb
-------
flexible -> repid prototyping.
great for javascript (read node) applications cause you can save -
JS objecs/json directly to mongodb and read it as such.
beware that it puts a lot of pressure on the developer being good, a lot of things - 
need to happen in the app layer. 
it is easy to use but easier to really mess up your data in a big way.
It is amazing for sharding /clustering

can you combine them? yes
mysql - for all the business data
mongodb - for all the logs
